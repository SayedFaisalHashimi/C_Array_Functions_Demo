# C Array Functions Demo

A C program demonstrating **array manipulation** with robust, modular functions. This project calculates the **maximum, minimum, sum, and average** of integer arrays while validating user input and handling edge cases.

---

## Features

- **Safe Input Handling:** Validates array size (1–100) and ensures each element is an integer.
- **Array Operations:** Compute maximum, minimum, sum, and average of array elements.
- **Modular Design:** Functions for input, display, max, min, and sum & average calculations.
- **Pointer Usage:** Demonstrates modifying variables in `main()` via pointers.
- **Clean Output:** Prints arrays and results neatly for clarity.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SayedFaisalHashimi/C_Array_Functions_Demo.git
````

### Compile and Run

```bash
gcc array_functions_demo.c -o array_demo
./array_demo
```

Follow the prompts to input the array size and elements.

---

## Example Output

```
Enter the size (1-100): 5
Enter element 1: 10
Enter element 2: 5
Enter element 3: 8
Enter element 4: 12
Enter element 5: 3

You entered the following numbers:
10 5 8 12 3

Max element: 12
Min element: 3
Sum: 38
Average: 7.60
```

## What I Learned

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in:

* **C Fundamentals:** Arrays, loops, conditionals, functions.
* **Pointers & Memory:** Passing by reference to safely update variables.
* **Modular Programming:** Breaking problems into reusable, maintainable functions.
* **Input Validation:** Ensuring programs handle unexpected or invalid input.
* **Problem Solving & Debugging:** Handling edge cases like empty arrays or division by zero.
* **Professional Git Practices:** Meaningful, incremental commits with clear messages.

---

## Future Enhancements

* Support for **dynamic arrays** to handle any size input.
* Extend functionality for **sorting, searching, or other operations**.
* Add support for **floating-point numbers**.
* Create a **menu-driven interface** for multiple operations in a single run.
